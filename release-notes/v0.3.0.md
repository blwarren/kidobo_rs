# Release v0.3.0


### Added

- Added configurable firewall chain action via `ipset.chain_action` with
  allowed values `DROP` (default) and `REJECT` for kidobo chain rules.

### Fixed

- Path resolution no longer hard-fails when the process current directory is
  unavailable unless repo config fallback is explicitly enabled. This allows
  `kidobo init` and other default-path flows to run deterministically.
