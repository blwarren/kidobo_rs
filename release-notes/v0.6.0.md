# Release v0.6.0

### Added

- New offline overlap analysis command: `kidobo analyze overlap`.
- Optional overlap outputs: `--print-fully-covered-local` and
  `--print-reduced-local`.
- New apply option: `kidobo analyze overlap --apply-fully-covered-local` to
  remove local entries fully covered by cached remote sources (then run
  `kidobo sync` to apply to firewall/ipset runtime state).

### Changed

- CLI help text is clearer and more descriptive.
- Logging behavior is more predictable and configurable:
  `KIDOBO_LOG_FORMAT=auto|human|journal` and
  `KIDOBO_LOG_COLOR=auto|always|never`.
