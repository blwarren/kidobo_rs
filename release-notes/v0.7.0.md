# Release v0.7.0


### Added

- `kidobo ban` / `kidobo unban` now support ASN targets via `--asn` (accepting
  both bare values like `213412` and prefixed values like `AS213412`), with
  persistent config-backed ASN ban state in `[asn].banned`.
- Sync now treats ASN bans as first-class blocklist sources by resolving ASN
  prefixes through `bgpq4`, caching per-ASN prefix data under cache state, and
  refreshing stale ASN cache entries (default every `86400` seconds).

### Fixed

- Config validation now parses `safe.ips` entries as strict IP/CIDR tokens during config load and fails fast on invalid entries, instead of silently dropping invalid safelist values at sync time.

### Changed

- Internal runtime typing is stricter for validated config and adapter boundaries: `ipset.hashsize`/`ipset.maxelem` and remote timeout/stale windows now use validated newtypes, HTTP response status uses typed status codes, and command execution status uses an explicit process-status enum.
- `kidobo doctor` now includes a required binary check for `bgpq4`, and
  `kidobo init` now fails fast when `bgpq4` is missing from `PATH`.
