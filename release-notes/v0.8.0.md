# Release v0.8.0


### Changed

- `kidobo lookup --file` now prints a `NO_MATCH` line for each valid target IP/CIDR that has no overlap with any loaded local/cached source, and ends with a brief summary line: total unique valid targets, unique matched targets, and matched percentage.
- `kidobo lookup` CLI argument validation now uses an explicit one-of input mode (`<IP_OR_CIDR>` or `--file <PATH>`) so usage/help and missing-argument errors reflect the intended mutually exclusive modes.
- `kidobo doctor` now logs a compact summary line (`overall`, total checks, failed checks, skipped checks) instead of logging the full JSON payload a second time; stdout remains the single source for full JSON report output.
- IPv4 interval merge/collapse sorting now uses a hybrid strategy: `sort_unstable` for smaller interval sets and radix sorting for larger sets, reducing sort overhead on high-cardinality source unions.
- Core performance benchmarks now include a dedicated `merge_intervals_ipv4` Criterion group to isolate `merge_intervals_u32` behavior across deterministic interval shapes (`disjoint_sorted`, `disjoint_shuffled`, `overlap_sorted`) at larger input sizes.
- Core performance benchmarks now also support a real-world dataset mode (via `KIDOBO_BENCH_ROOT`, default `.local-scenarios/real`) that benchmarks `merge_intervals_u32` and `compute_effective_blocklists` against local blocklist + cached remote `.iplist` inputs and parsed safelist config.
- Real-world benchmark mode now supports optional remote cache population from configured feeds (`KIDOBO_BENCH_FETCH_REMOTE=1`) before measurement, so benchmark datasets can mirror configured local+remote source volume.
- Benchmark coverage now includes `disjoint_almost_sorted` and real-world scale-up variants (`1x/2x/5x/10x`) for merge and effective blocklist computations to better characterize sort sensitivity and growth behavior.
- `merge_intervals_ipv4` benchmarks now include a radix-sort prototype path (`*_radix`) to compare radix-vs-`sort_unstable` tradeoffs under deterministic and real-world interval orders.
- Real-world merge benchmarks now include `source_sorted_concat` (and radix equivalent), modeling source-wise sorted lists concatenated in deterministic source order.
