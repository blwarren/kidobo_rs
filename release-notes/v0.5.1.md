# Release v0.5.1

### Changed

- `kidobo lookup` now streams matches directly to output while preserving deterministic ordering, instead of accumulating all matches in memory first. This reduces peak RAM use and avoids large global sort/dedup overhead on large target/source combinations.
- `kidobo sync` now uses lightweight `ipset list <set> -terse` probing for set existence checks (with compatibility fallback), avoiding expensive full-set listings in the common path.
- Remote sync fetch worker selection is now CPU-aware (`available_parallelism`) while still capped by `MAX_REMOTE_FETCH_WORKERS`, reducing oversubscription pressure on single-core hosts.
- Ipset restore script generation now skips redundant sort/dedup work when entries are already sorted and unique, reducing CPU and allocation overhead on the sync hot path.
- Remote cache normalization now formats canonical CIDRs without building an intermediate `Vec<String>`, reducing temporary allocations during source processing.
