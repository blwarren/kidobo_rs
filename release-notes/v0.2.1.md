# Release v0.2.1

### Changed

- `kidobo lookup` now labels remote matches with the original source URL from
  cache metadata (instead of hashed cache filenames), improving provenance in
  offline lookup output.
- Documentation and maintenance scripts now explicitly use
  `cargo +nightly udeps --all-targets --all-features` for dependency-usage
  checks to match CI behavior.
- Remote conditional-fetch behavior is now shared through a common adapter
  helper, reducing duplicated cache revalidation logic between remote feed and
  GitHub meta loaders.
- `kidobo sync` remote ingestion now keeps parsed CIDRs from cache fetch results
  and avoids reparsing normalized `.iplist` text in worker threads.
- Lookup matching now pre-indexes source CIDR intervals per family, reducing
  repeated overlap scanning work for multi-target lookups.
- Sync/carve normalization now removes redundant collapse/sort/merge passes in
  the core blocklist pipeline while preserving deterministic output ordering.
- Removed the unused `reqwest` `json` feature from dependency configuration.

### Fixed

- Remote feed metadata cache parse/read failures now degrade gracefully to
  metadata-free operation, preserving stale `.iplist` fallback behavior instead
  of hard-failing the source load.
- `kidobo` now exits with code `130` when `SIGINT` is received during command
  execution (after the current command step returns), not only before dispatch.
