# Release v0.1.2


### Changed

- Logs are now emitted in a plain `level=<LEVEL> msg=<text>` format without
  ANSI styling or duplicated timestamps, which is easier to read in systemd
  journal output.
- Added configurable remote HTTP request timeout via `remote.timeout_secs`
  (default `30`, range `[1, 3600]`).
- `kidobo init` now prints a deterministic summary of created and unchanged
  paths on successful completion.

### Fixed

- `kidobo sync` now fails early with a clear message when effective IPv4/IPv6
  entries exceed configured `ipset.maxelem`, instead of relying only on a later
  `ipset restore` command failure.
- Command execution now drains `stdout` and `stderr` concurrently while processes
  run, preventing pipe-buffer deadlocks/timeouts on large command output.
