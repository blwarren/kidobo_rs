# Release v0.1.3


### Changed

- Release automation now resolves release notes from the tag name
  (`release-notes/<tag>.md`) and supports manual reruns for existing tags via
  `workflow_dispatch`.
- `kidobo init` now runs `systemctl daemon-reload` and
  `systemctl enable --now kidobo-sync.timer` automatically when using default
  system paths (the `KIDOBO_ROOT` sandbox flow still skips `systemctl`).
